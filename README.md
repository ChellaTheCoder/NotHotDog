What would you say if I told you there is a app on the market that tell you if you have a hotdog or not a hotdog.

This app is a clone of Jian Yang's SeeFood app from HBO's [Silicon Valley](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/).

This app uses LabelDetector offered by Firebase to label images and find out if hotdogs are present.

To run this app on your phone you can download the apk [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RXUGdVFPQs7jaEnHqEANJboAN7K6ojJL/view).

If you want to build the application yourself you can create a project in Firebase and add an android app and download the **googleServices.json** and paste it inside *android/app/* and you're good to go.
